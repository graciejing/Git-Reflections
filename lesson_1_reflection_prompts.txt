How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

The FC function was able to isolate a small section of the code that had the bug
more quickly. This definitely saved a lot of time that would have otherwise been
spent combing through the 1000+ lines of code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having access to the entire history of a file allows for version control. This
means that if you change anything major from a previous version, you can see
what it used to be as reference. You also don't have to be as worried about
changing up code.

------------------------------------------------------
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

By manually choosing when to commit, the responsibility falls completely on the
user. This way, they have a better idea of the stopping points or checkpoints
for the commits and can more easily refer back to them.
------------------------------------------------------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think this is because each Google Doc is a seperate entity that is independent
of any other file. With code, however, there are files that are linked together
and need to be able to access each other in order to run properly. That's why
Git allows saving multiple files in one commit. (multiple files that are in
one repo are all committed)


------------------------------------------------------
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows the user the commit history for a file. git diff does the same
as FC in the terminal but comparing different commits from the git log.

------------------------------------------------------
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Because you have a saved version that you can always revert to, version control
allows people to take more risks when changing code that could potentially break
things. You can also look back at code from previous commits to see where
things went wrong.

------------------------------------------------------
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git for version control and to be able to contribute to more open
source code. I also want to just practice using and getting comfortable with
the command line.
