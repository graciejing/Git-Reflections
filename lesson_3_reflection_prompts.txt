1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

It's nice to have a remote repository because then you can access these files
from anywhere. If you keep all your work local then you need to access that
specific laptop or computer at all times to edit the work.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's better to manually pull changes so that you can control what changes you
pull to your local repository. There could be commits on your remote that could
mess with your current files, so it's better to be able to choose when to pull.
